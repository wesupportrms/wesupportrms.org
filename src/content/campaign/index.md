## The Truth

* In **2008** Jeffrey Epstein had faced charges in Florida that could have put him in prison for life, but thanks to a shameful [non-prosecution agreement (NPA)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Epstein_Non-Prosecution_Agreement_and_Addendum.pdf) facilitated by US attorney Alexander Acosta (subsequently US secretary of labor under Trump), Epstein managed to avoid full prosecution and ended up serving just 13 months in prison under extraordinary privileged conditions [[1\]](#ref1)

* [Excerpts of emails and letters](https://web.archive.org/web/20150906024049/http://images.politico.com/global/2015/07/07/epsteinsealedsupp.pdf) disclosed in **2015** revealed a covert negotiation between Epstein's lawyers and the Government to keep the non-prosecution agreement secret from the victims and the general public. This secrecy was a violation of the Crime Victims’ Rights Act that prevented the victims from discussing the terms of the agreement or taking action to prevent it. The agreement was declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in February 2019, but was not invalidated by the Department of Justice.[[2\]](#ref2)

* MIT Media Lab professor Marvin Minsky died on **January 24, 2016**.

* In **April 2019**, RMS writed article [25 April 2019(Plea deal for Epstein)](https://stallman.org/archives/2019-jan-apr.html#25_April_2019_(Plea_deal_for_Epstein)) .

  >I wonder whether this makes it possible to resentence him to a longer prison term.
  >
  >I disagree with some of what the article says about Epstein. Epstein is not, apparently, a pedophile, since the people he raped seem to have all been postpuberal.
  >
  >By contrast, **calling him a “sex offender” tends to minimize his crimes**, since it groups him with people who committed a spectrum of acts of varying levels of gravity. Some of them were not crimes. Some of these people didn't actually do anything to anyone.

  >**I think the right term for a person such as Epstein is “serial rapist”**.

  

* On **July 7, 2019**, Billionaire sex-trafficking criminal Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in New Jersey.

* In **August 2019**, the acknowledgement by [MIT Media Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab) director Joi Ito that the laboratory had surreptitiously accepted Epstein's post-conviction donations.[[3\]](#ref3)

  MIT commissioned an investigation, the results of which were published on January 10, 2020. The [report](https://stallmansupport.org/docs/MIT-report.pdf) shows that Epstein had sponsored, through his charitable foundations, the projects of several professors at the Media Lab, starting with a donation to Marvin Minsky's artificial intelligence project in September 12, 2002—four years before Epstein was first charged with sex crimes. Earlier that same year, on April 14-16, Minsky and some of his colleagues had held an AI symposium in the US Virgin Islands, and a second one took place in December 2011, both sponsored by Epstein.[[4\]](#ref4)

  **The investigation found no evidence of further donations from Epstein to support Minsky's work**.[[5\]](#ref5) 

  

* On **August 9, 2019**, the unsealing of a [deposition](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14ZOEKwoBnDKUFI1hLbFJH5nsUFxrmNhs&export=download) by one of Epstein's victims, **Virginia Giuffre née Roberts (born August 9th, 1983)**, in which she testified, among many other things, that Epstein's partner Ghislaine Maxwell had “directed” her to have sex with MIT Media Lab professor Marvin Minsky and other men.

  **However, it's unclear whether any sexual encounters actually took place with Minsky.**

  - Physicist and science fiction author Greg Benford reported that he was present when Virginia Roberts approached Minsky: If Marvin had done it, she would say so. I know. I was there. Minsky turned her down. Told me about it. She saw us talking and didn’t approach me.[[6\]](#ref6)

    Benford is probably referring to the conference held in the US Virgin Islands in April 2002, when Virginia was 18. 

  -  Minsky's widow, Gloria Rudisch, has said: We were always together. We didn’t stay at his house or anything.[[7\]](#ref7)

* On **September 10, 2019**, an email announcing the protest that was organized at MIT against the institution's involvement with Epstein was sent to the CSAIL(Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab) mailing list.

    >Epstein's donations. I have also attached a text version for people who are
    >pay-walled.
    >According to the e-mails, in July 2014, after Epstein made a $50,000 gift
    >
    >\> to MIT, Richard MacMillan, then a senior director for large individual
    >\> domestic gifts for the university, alerted the Media Lab to the problems
    >\> associated with the donation.
    >\> “Recall we are not taking gifts from him,” MacMillan wrote to Peter Cohen,
    >\> who was then the Media Lab’s director of development and strategy.
    >\> Cohen responded that he had spoken to Ito and that Epstein had an account
    >\> that allowed him to make small gifts anonymously.
    >\> In a July 28, 2014, e-mail exchange, Cohen relayed that Ito had told him
    >\> that the recording secretary who helped the university track gifts
    >\> “maintains this account and knows the drill.’’
    >\> Then, another person, who is not identified in the e-mails obtained by the
    >\> Globe, explains to several people on the e-mail chain that the recording
    >\> secretary “should be reminded of Epstein’s anonymous status. There must be
    >\> some kind of note they can add to his record to assure that all these gifts
    >\> continue to get recorded as such.’’
    >\> MacMillan then responded: “No it’s all set. She is taking care of it.’’

    >\> ======
    >\> CW: child abuse, sex-trafficking.
    >\> Top MIT officials covered up Epstein’s donations to the Institute. MIT
    >\> Professors and officials visited him in prison, flew on his “Lolita
    >\> Express,” invited him to campus, and gave him awards. MIT CANNOT be trusted
    >\> to investigate itself through an “independent” law firm that they
    >\> themselves hire and that reports to the MIT Corporation. WE, students,
    >\> staff, faculty, and Boston-area community members MUST hold MIT accountable
    >\> for this and more!! What happens next is on us!
    >\> Background:
    >\> Jeffery Epstein was a multimillionaire serial child abuser and sex
    >\> trafficker who eluded serious justice for many years (his 18-month sentence
    >\> from 2008, of which he served 13 months, was a slap on the wrist [1]) by
    >\> surrounding himself with powerful men and powerful institutions. He
    >\> maintained these networks of powerful men by writing them big checks
    >\> through his “philanthropic” activities, including philanthropic activities
    >\> to MIT. He cultivated very close relationships with several MIT figures,
    >\> including Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte, former Media Lab director
    >\> Joi Ito, deceased AI “pioneer” Marvin Minsky (who is accused of assaulting
    >\> one of Epstein’s victims [2]), and Professor Seth Lloyd, who visited
    >\> Epstein during his prison term and accepted grants afterwards, per his own
    >\> public apology. MIT had internally “disqualified” Epstein as a donor. That
    >\> meant MIT officially would not take Epstein’s money. But Joi Ito wanted
    >\> Epstein's money anyway, and so Media Lab officials and other top MIT
    >\> officials, such as MIT’s VP of Resource Development Julie Lucas as well as
    >\> Richard MacMillan (a senior director under Lucas), worked together to cover
    >\> up Epstein’s donations by anonymizing them. This is what the latest article
    >\> on the MIT-Epstein scandal reveals.
    >\> https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/09/09/top-mit-officials-knew-epstein-ties-media-labmails-show/OFEzFtD0mgic2zzXOSPe9J/story.html

    >\> immoral. It violated MIT’s own donor policies. All senior administrators
    >\> who knew about these donations MUST RESIGN IMMEDIATELY.
    >\> But individual resignations aren’t enough. The Epstein scandal demonstrates
    >\> a rot at the heart of the Media Lab [3] and MIT as a whole. It gets at more
    >\> profound issues regarding how MIT finances its activities and who it
    >\> partners with to perform research. We demand an end to dark money. We
    >\> demand an end to the pernicious influence that millionaire pedophiles,
    >\> genocidal crown princes, billionaire climate change deniers, and giant
    >\> corporations profiting from wars, deportations, and concentration camps at
    >\> the border hold over MIT and academia generally. MAKE YOUR VOICES HEARD!

		>The announcement of the Friday event does an injustice to Marvin Minsky:
		>
		>\> deceased AI “pioneer” Marvin Minsky (who is accused of
		>\> assaulting one of Epstein’s victims [2])
		>
		>**The injustice is in the word "assaulting". The term "sexual assault" is so vague and slippery that it facilitates accusation inflation:** taking claims that someone did X and leading people to think of it as Y, which is much worse than X.
		>
		>The accusation quoted is a clear example of inflation. The reference reports the claim that Minsky had sex with one of Epstein's harem. (See https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed.) **Let's presume that was true (I see no reason to disbelieve it).**
		>
		>The word "assaulting" presumes that he applied force or violence, in some unspecified way, but the article itself says no such thing. Only that they had sex.
		>
		>We can imagine many scenarios, but **the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him \*as\* entirely willing.** Assuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates.
		>
		>I've concluded from various examples of accusation inflation that it is absolutely wrong to use the term "sexual assault" in an accusation.
		>
		>**Whatever conduct you want to criticize, you should describe it with a specific term that avoids moral vagueness about the nature of the criticism.**

	  >Dr. Stallman - If we're debating the definitions of "rape" and "sexual assault," perhaps it's better to accept that this conversation isn't productive. **When this email chain inevitably finds its way into the press,** the seeming **insensitivity** of some will reflect poorly on the entire CSAIL community. **Regardless of intent**, this thread reads as "grasping at straws **to defend our friends" around potential involvement with Epstein**, and that isn't a reputation I would like attached to my CSAIL affiliation.
	
* On **September 13, 2019**, Selam Jie Gano immediately leaked the conversation chain to the media and published a blog post calling for the removal of Stallman that triggered the [defamation](https://stallmansupport.org/say-it-with-a-meme.html#defamation) attacks.

* On **September 16, 2019**, Richard M. Stallman, founder and president of the Free Software Foundation, resigned as president and from its board of directors.

* On **March 21, 2021**, Richard M. Stallman announced he is member of the board again.
